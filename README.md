# TotalBrainVolume

This is my final degree project of my studies in Computer Engineering at University of CÃ¡diz. It was graded with a 10 out of 10 and was proposed to receive an honorific mention.

This MATLAB application does automatic brain segmentation from 3D ulrasounds using deep learning.

## Execution

- Run SegmentaVCT.mlapp file using MATLAB

## Usage

- In the folder "Ecografias" you can find some ultrasound examples.
- Push the button "Abrir" to open an ultrosound file. The app can read .nrrd, .nii, .vol (Cartesian) 
- You need to order the volume using the "permuta" buttons to follow the order AXIAL SAGITTAL CORONAL.
- Once you get the planes in the right order, you can push the button "Segmentar Cerebro".
